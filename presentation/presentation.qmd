-   Federica is a statistician and actuary who works as an independent researcher.
    She is always open to new insights about data modeling and visualization and
    is an enthusiast of the R programming language. Federica enjoys finding hidden
    patterns and learning new things.

-   Federica also works on improving modeling techniques, she is interested in
    infectious diseases and spatial data with R. Furthermore, she is the author of
    the package `Oregonfrogs` where she shares her insights and experiences on
    data analysis and visualization. She is also working on an insightful book
    about
    `Health metrics and the spread of infectious diseases with machine learning applications and spatial model analysis`
    which includes a package called infectious. Eventually, she has reviewed
    various articles in her field.

I have always liked that `law of large numbers (LLN)`, which states:

> "It guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events"

## How I keep going learning and practicing? {.smaller}

-   `R-Ladies` events for learning and networking. It's a good environment for
    practicing organizing tutorials.
-   The [`R4DS community`](https://rfordatascience.slack.com/), I enjoys
    statistics, book clubs and learn advanced modeling techniques. This can be
    challenging sometimes.
-   `IHME` as a collaborator, author, and reviewer, I read papers and propose
    changes. It is a rewarding experience.

# OregonFrogs

## A trip to Spatial Modeling with R {.smaller}

This is my project package for spatial modeling. I stomped into this set of data
during a data-search for a visualization, and immediately saw its potential. It is
a simple collection of information about a species of frog `Rana Pretiosa` which
is found in Oregon around the area of the `Crane Prairie Reservoir` an artificial
lake. Frogs are studied in their habitat and monitored with a `Radio Telemetry`.
Frequencies identify the frog location releasing information about the frogs, if
they are visualized, not visualized or captured, and in what habitat.

> Original source of data is a @USGS study from Pearl, C.A., Rowe, J.C., McCreary,
> B., and Adams, M.J., 2022. Geological Survey data release:
> <https://doi.org/10.5066/P9DACPCV>.

## What is inside oregonfrogs package? {.scrollable .smaller}

`oregonfrogs` is made of 311 observations, 15 variables including spatial
information, longitude and latitude, the detection status, if visualised or not,
or captured, there are information about the habitat and most importantly the
frequencies emitted by a radio telemetry to monitor the frogs status.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(oregonfrogs)
knitr::kable(oregonfrogs)
```




# Map {.smaller}

The location of `Rana Pretiosa` is the `Crane Prairie Reservoir` artificial lake
in Oregon, US.

#| eval: false

leaflet() %>%

  addMarkers(lng=-121.800973 , lat =43.787527, 
             popup="Crane Prairie Reservoir") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng=oregonfrogs::oregonfrogs$long,

# Shiny

Frequency distribution of radio telemetry results about localization of the frogs
in one area more than onther is very important.
